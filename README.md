# Lewis In Space

Our team has created a choose your own adventure game featuring Lewis the Dog (a King Cavalier Charles Spaniel who often comes into Alchemy Code Lab with the owners: Marty and Megan.) We pick up our story on Episode 4 as an homage to the Star Wars franchise. Lewis has been lost in space and is ready to make his way home. The user will make a series of decisions to see if Lewis makes it home or not. On his journey, Lewis will be faced with some moral quandaries that will ultimately decide his fate.
