Your space ship is low on snack fuel and as soon as you run out, the slime pirates will catch you, steal your ship, and turn you into a slime dog.',

        result: 'The slime pirates thank you for telling them about the cruise ship, but they want to take your ship and turn you into a slime dog anyway. Lucky for you, the cruise ship changes course and the pirates only have time to raid one of you. They chase the cruise ship, leaving you with enough fuel to continue your journey.

An asteroid big enough to destroy a major city is heading straight toward their planet, and you are the only ship close enough to take action to divert it.',

Even if you could get to the asteroid in time, you could easily run out of fuel and never make it home to Planet Alchemy where you have friends and family waiting for you. With some reluctance, you continue on your journey as if you never heard the distress signal',
    choice1aResult: 'Your outrageous, brave plan to save Furtuna9 worked! A small nudge from your ship changed the course of the asteroid enough that it missed the cat planet. Unfortunately, you\'ve used up most of your snack fuel and are at risk of becoming stranded in space. You have to make a stop and take some risks to get more fuel.',
    choice1bResult: 'By the time the asteroid strikes Furtuna9, you are about to cross out of cat-space with plenty of snack fuel to continue your journey. You can\'t see the impact and the planet is just a dot in the distance. You put it out of your mind, but you\'ve changed.'

Although some think you two make an odd pair, you have a surprising amount in common. For instance, you are both very protective of your personal space. You decide to surprise her with a visit. You land and your friend comes out to greet you, but when you give her a big hug (with your eyes), you notice how thin she is. Fluffy reluctantly admits that she\'s been out of snacks for weeks, which means no food and no fuel.',

Give a Wampa a snack, feed her for a day, but teach a Wampa to get snacks, she feeds herself without taking from her friends.',
    choice2aResult: 'You fly away from Algid after a long, pleasant visit during which you and Fluffy always stayed an appropriate distance apart. You are a little concerned about your own snack fuel levels, but you feel good about helping your friend and know she would have done the same for you.',
    choice2bResult: 'You fly away from Algid after a short, pleasant visit. You were clear about your boundaries, and that\'s important in a friendship, right? You hope Fluffy does the right thing, using those snacks to find work rather than binge eating them.'
